Initial version of the perl form of mp3slurp.

As the existing code is written, curl is required to
live in /usr/bin/curl.  This could be rewritten to use
WWW::Curl.

mp3list.pl will scrape a given webpage for all the
mp3s links, and return a list of urls to the mp3s.

mp3slurpl.pl takes a list of urls, and downloads
each one using curl.  

Usage:

perl mp3list.pl <website> | perl mp3slurp.pl
